DESCRIPTION:
    This function automates the process of recording audio using the Voice Recorder app on Windows.
    It captures the start time of the app and the precise time when the recording starts, 
    performs the recording for the specified duration, and stops the recording afterward.
    The timestamps are formatted for compatibility with Asg trace logs (in UTC with milliseconds).
INPUT PARAMETERS:
    - scnds [int] :- The duration (in seconds) for which the audio will be recorded.
RETURN TYPE:
    - array (Returns an array containing the start time of the Voice Recorder app and the start time of the audio recording.)
