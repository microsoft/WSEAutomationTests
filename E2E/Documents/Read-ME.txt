Test Overview:
The Automation script supports all Socs and MEP versions.
 
Coverage and Validation:
• Validates the availability and functionality of Windows Studio Effects (camera and audio) toggles, ensuring they can be toggled On/Off.
• Validates video fps > 29fps.
• Validates AvgWorkingSetSize < 250MB
• Validates PeakWorkingSetSize does not increase by more than 1000KB during video recording.
• Validates tests are conducted across various parameters, including resolutions, power states etc
• Validates Windows Studio Effects(WSE) is not supported in Photo Mode.
• Validates the correct scenarioId is generated for both individual and combined effects
• Verifies the number of frames exceeding 33ms in processing time.
• Verifies that the PC session is properly initialized and completed, including logs for "Starting Microsoft.ASG.Perception" and "Stopping Microsoft.ASG.Perception."
• Captures KPIs - time to first frame, camera Init Time, video fps
• Captures NPU and CPU usage by taking Task Manager screenshots.
• Captures NPU and CPU and memory usage before test starts
• Captures NPU and CPU and memory usage while test is running.

Test Runs Description:
We have below sets of Test Runs:
1. CheckInTest.ps1:
•  Runs tests with each effect enabled and verifies that effects can be toggled On/Off, and the correct scenario ID is generated. Also, includes an end-to-end test for both Camera and Voice Recorder, with device plugged in and unplugged.

2. ReleaseTest.ps1:
•  Runs 800+ tests with various combinations of Camera effects, Voice Focus, video/photo resolution, and plugged-in/unplugged scenarios.
•  Supports multiple video and photo resolutions across different devices. You can adjust the resolutions based on the device being tested.

3. StressTest.ps1:
•  A series of tests designed to put the device under stress (both plugged in and unplugged). Such as toggling AI Effects multiple times, Revisiting Camera setting page multiple times, maximizing/minimizing camera multiple times, Putting the device under hibernation etc.
Set up for Hibernation
#Please run Powercfg.exe /hibernate on as Admin on command prompt. Than open control panel> hardware and Sound> Power options > Click on "Choose what the power options do" and enable Hibernation checkbox.
#Setup wake timers- Open control panel>Power options>"Edit Plan setting" for the power plan u are using. Then Select "Change adavanced power setting". Go to Sleep > "Allow wake timers" and enable them
#For Auto-login- Open Edit group policy>Click Administrative Templates> System > Power Management> Sleep Settings > Disable "Require a password when a computer wakes(plugged in) and "Require a password when a computer wakes(on battery)

4. MemoryUsage-Set.ps1:
•   Captures PeakWorkingSetSize for the frame server process every few minutes while video recording with Windows Studio Effects(camera and audio) enabled, for both plugged-in and unplugged scenarios.

5. Framedrop-Fps-Testing.ps1:
•   Captures key performance indicators (KPIs) like video fps, processing time, frame above 33ms, etc., by running the same camera E2E scenario in a loop with the device plugged in and unplugged.

6. CameraReliabilityTest.ps1
• Executes long-duration reliability testing across multiple iterations and resolution combinations.
• Helps identify stability and soak-related issues over extended runs.

7. ScenarioTest.ps1
• Runs individual scenarios in isolation for focused validation.
• Provides detailed scenario-level logging to assist debugging and repro.

8. CheckInTest_External_USB_Camera.ps1
• Runs the same Check-In tests on external USB cameras.
• Verifies effect toggling, scenario ID generation, and Camera/Voice Recorder end-to-end scenarios for both plugged-in and unplugged states.

How to Run the Script:
1. Pre-test Steps:
   Before running the script, manually verify the following:
   -Ensure you can toggle the audio and camera effects on the settings page.
   -Verify that audio and video recording works, and that the Camera app and Settings page open maximized.
2. Download the E2E folder from the repository.
3. Launch an elevated PowerShell session and navigate to the E2E folder.
4. Execute the following command to run one of the test ps1
C:\E2E> .\CheckInTest.ps1 -tokenId  -smartplugId -targetMepCameraVer -targetMepAudioVer -targetPerceptionCoreVer
(Provide tokenId and smartplugId to run the test in both plugged-in and unplugged states. Provide expected MEP and PC version to validate targeted MEP and PC version)

Logs Generation:
Logs are saved in the following format: E2E\Logs\<DateTime>-<TestRunName>
For eg: E2E\Logs\ 2023-12-12-09-26-02-Checkin-Test or E2E\Logs\ 2023-12-12-09-26-02-ReleaseTest
 
Interpretation of Console Output:
•	Scenario : Result (Execution Time in seconds)
•	For example: Pluggedin\Automatic-Framing : Passed (159.27)
